    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of classification, a decision tree helps to classify an input data point into one of several predefined classes. The decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data based on features, leading to a tree-like structure of decision nodes and leaf nodes."
